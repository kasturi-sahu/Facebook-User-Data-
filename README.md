In this project, I want to perform Exploratory Data Analysis with Facebook data set. This data set contains almost 60,000 users and it varies from age, birthday, gender, to likes, mobile likes, etc.

Facebook, a social networking site, is used exchanging information, ideas, marketing and selling products. We shall study the datasets available to understand how are the trends in the following: 
•Distribution of users 
•Various activities by users 
•Understand patterns across genders, age groups and tenure of the users

This project was created as a part of the INSAID capstone.

In this project we can understand the below:
•While there are more male user accounts, female users (especially teenagers) seem to be more active on facebook
•Users have a tendency of using facebook over mobile at younger age and over webpage as age grows
•Increase in activities observed in age group between 51 to 80 years
•More male user accounts become inactive as the tenure grows
